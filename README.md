Higher level access to the ghcjs-vdom library. This also adds events. ghcjs-shakespeare-dynamic uses this to build on top of with quasiquoting and rendering.

ghcjs-vdom

The main library used for building dom that can be manipulated and modified. This allows for quasiquoting hamlet-like segments with composition of those segments.
